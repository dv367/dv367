### 5.1 Basic Terminologies  

* **Graph** - is a collection of nodes/vertices and edges, $G = (V,E)$.  
* **Undirected Graph** - If for each node $V_{i}$ that is connected to $V_{j}$, both $E_{ij}$ and $E_{ji}$ exists. We can connect both nodes with a single undirected edge such that robot can traverse from $V_{j}$ to $V_i$ and $V_i$ to $V_j$. Such graph is called undirected graph.
* **Directed Graph** - If for each node $V_{i}$ that is connected to $V_{j}$, only $E_{ij}$ exists i.e. the robot can only traverse from $V_i$ to $V_j$. Such graph is called directed graph.
* **Path** - in a graph is a sequence of nodes $V_i$ such that for adjacent nodes $V_{i+1}$ are connected.
* **Cycle** - is a path of $n$ nodes, where $V_1 = V_n$.
* **Tree** - is a directed graph with no cycles.
  * **Root** - is a special node which has no incoming edges.
  * **Leaf** - is a node with no children.

* **Grid** - induces a graph where each node corresponds to a pixel and an edge connects nodes of pixels that neigbhour each other.
* **Four-point connectivity**- assumes only four neigbhours i.e. the robot has a choice of moving to one of the four neigbhours at a time.
* **Eight-point connectivity**- assumes eight neigbhours i.e. the robot has a choice of moving to one of the eight neighbours at a time.

### 5.2 Depth-First vs Breadth-First Search
* **Depth-First Search** - starts at the root, chooses a child, then that node's child and so on until finding either the desired node or a leaf.
* **Breadth-First Search** - is the opposite of Depth-First. The search starts at the root and then visits all the children of that root first. Next, the search then visits all of the grandchildren, and so forth.  
In the following figure, the numbers on each node represents the order in which the nodes are expanded in the search.
