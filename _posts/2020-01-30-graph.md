### 5.1 Basic Terminologies  

* **Graph** - is a collection of nodes/vertices and edges, $G = (V,E)$.
* **Undirected Graph** - If for each node $V_{i}$ that is connected to $V_{j}$, both $E_{ij}$ and $E_{ji}$ exists. We can connect both nodes with a single undirected edge such that robot can traverse from $V_{j}$ to $V_i$ and $V_i$ to $V_j$. Such graph is called undirected graph.
* **Directed Graph** - If for each node $V_{i}$ that is connected to $V_{j}$, only $E_{ij}$ exists i.e. the robot can only traverse from $V_i$ to $V_j$. Such graph is called directed graph.
* **Path** - in a graph is a sequence of nodes $V_i$ such that for adjacent nodes $V_{i+1}$ are connected.
* **Cycle** - is a path of $n$ nodes, where $V_1 = V_n$.
* **Tree** - is a directed graph with no cycles.
  + **Root** - is a special node which has no incoming edges.
  + **Leaf** - is a node with no children.
