## Graph Representation and Basic Search

### Basic Terminologies  

* **Graph** - is a collection of nodes/vertices and edges, $G = (V,E)$
* **Undirected Graph** - If for each node $V_{i}$ that is connected to $V_{j}$, both $E_{ij}$ and $E_{ji}$ exists. We can connect both nodes with a single undirected edge such that robot can traverse from $V_{j}$ to $V_i$ and $V_i$ to $V_j$. Such graph is called undirected graph.
* **Directed Graph** - If for each node $V_{i}$ that is connected to $V_{j}$, only $E_{ij}$ exists i.e. the robot can only traverse from $V_i$ to $V_j$. Such graph is called directed graph.
