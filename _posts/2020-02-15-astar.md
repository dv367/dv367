### 7.1 Recall!
From the previous post, we learned that $$f(n) = h(n)$$ search becomes **greedy** and $$f(n) = g(n)$$ search grows path that is shortest from start until it encounters the goal(**Dijkstra's algorithm or Uninformed A\***). Now, the A\* algorithm is just the combination of both.

  $$f(n) = h(n) + g(n) \tag{1}$$
</p>
Now, lets take a deeper dive in the algorithm.

### 7.2 A\* Algorithm
I bet you remember all the terminologies.

Now, take a pen and a scratch paper and try to understand the algorithm by solving the following example.

Here, assume the function $h(s)$ gives the number of nodes $s$ is aways from $s_goal$.
