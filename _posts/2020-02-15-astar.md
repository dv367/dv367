### 7.1 Recall!
From the previous post, we learned that $$f(n) = h(n)$$ search becomes **greedy** and $$f(n) = g(n)$$ search grows path that is shortest from start until it encounters the goal(**Dijkstra's algorithm or Uninformed A\***). Now, the A\* algorithm is just the combination of both.

  $$f(n) = h(n) + g(n) \tag{1}$$

Now, lets take a deeper dive in the algorithm.

### 7.2 A\* Algorithm
I bet you remember all the terminologies.

Now, take a pen and a scratch paper and try to understand the algorithm by solving the following example. Assume the function $h(s)$ gives the number of nodes $s$ is away from $s_{goal}$ and $g(s) = g(s_{start}) + c(s_{start},s)$, where $c$ is the edge cost. So, $h(s_{goal}) = 0$ and $g(s_{start}) = 0$. Try it out on your own and compare it with the below table.

#### Table 1 Solution  

Node To Expand | OPEN | CLOSED | bp(s)
--- | --- | ---
$s_{start}$ | {$s_{start}$} | {} | \-
$s_2$ | {$s_2$} | {$s_{start}$} | $bp(s_2) = s_{start}$
$s_4$ | {$s_4, s_1$} | {$s_{start}, s_2$} | $bp(s_4) = bp(s_1) = s_2$ 
$s_1$ | {$s_3, s_1$} | {$s_{start}, s_2, s_4$} | $bp(s_3) = s_4$
$s_{goal}$ | {$s_3, s_{goal}$} | {$s_{start}, s_2, s_4, s_1$} | $bp(s_{goal}) = s_1$
\- | {$s_3$} | {$s_{start}, s_2, s_4, s_1, s_{goal}$} | \-

Finally, in order to find the least cost path, we have to just follow the backpointers all the way from $s_{goal}$ to $s_{start}$. So, in our case the path will be $s_{goal} \rightarrow s_1 \rightarrow s_2 \rightarrow s_{start}$.
