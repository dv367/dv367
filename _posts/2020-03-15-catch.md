### 10.1 Problem Setting

1. Robot moves with 8-point connectivity.
2. Target moves with 8-point connectivity.
3. Both the robot and target can execute only one move at a time.
4. The environment(2D) is unknown to the robot; the only known information is the position of the target.

### 10.2 Employ A*?

<p align="justify">
The first solution that anyone can think of: do a A\* search. But, there are some perks of target that we need to take into consideration: it can move i.e. goal changes; $g-values$ and $h-values$ of each node changes. Consequently, we need to continuously replan from scratch as the goal changes. Let's see how it performs:

Pretty easy, right? Let's take another environment:

</p>

<p align="justify">
Here, we can see that the A* algorithm fails in such a simple looking environment. We know that A* needs to start from scratch if the goal changes. In Figure 10.2, the target is continuously moving, and the A* algorithm is not able to search enough to escape the L-shaped obstacle. One solution to this: block the location which has been explored more than twice in an oscillatory motion.

### 10.3 Artificial Obstacles!
<p align="justify">
As said earlier, when a location is explored twice: we put an artifical obstacle on that location. Consequently, the A* algorithm won't visit the same node again and again.
There are two steps to put an artificial obstacle:
</p>  
* Detection of oscillation: to and fro motion
* Changing the node from free space to obstacle

### 10.4 Teleportation
<p align="justify">
Using the above method, the robot may sometimes find itself completely surrounded by obstacles (artificial and the original one's). In this case, the robot should ignore the target for a while and find the nearest free cell; further, it should run A* search to that free cell. Figure 10.5 clearly demonstrates this behaviour. Whenever this scenarios is encountered by the robot; it implies that the robot has completely explored that area and needs to move out.
