## 1.1 Simulations?  
The Turtlebot3 ros package will be used for the simulation purpose in most of the planning techniques. It is the most popular open source robot for education and research. It has three models: burger, waffle, waffle-pi. Here is the ros package [link](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot3).  

### 1.2 Burger Model:  
1. It is a differential drive robot with dimensions $138mm × 178mm × 192mm$  
2. The maximum linear velocity is 0.22 $m s^{-1}$ and anuglar velocity is 2.84 $rad s^{-1}$.
3. It has a 360 degree LIDAR, 9-Axis Intertial Measurement Unit and precise encoders.

These are the features we should care about.  

### 1.3 Configuration:  
The robot can move only in the 2D plane, $(x,y,\theta)$ is enough to represent it's configuration $q$. Therefore the dimensions of configuration space $Q$ will be $R^{2} $x$  S^{1}$.  
<p align="center">
$q = (x,y,\theta) \in Q = R^{2} $x$  S^{1}          (1)$
