## 1.1 Simulations?  
The Turtlebot3 ros package will be used for the simulation purpose in most of the planning techniques. It is the most popular open source robot for education and research. It has three models: burger, waffle, waffle-pi. Here is the ros package [link](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot3).  

### 1.2 Burger Model:  
1. It is a differential drive robot with dimensions $138mm × 178mm × 192mm$  
2. The maximum linear velocity is 0.22 $m s^{-1}$ and anuglar velocity is 2.84 $rad s^{-1}$.
3. It has a 360 degree LIDAR, 9-Axis Intertial Measurement Unit and precise encoders.

These are the features we should care about. More [info](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/)

### 1.3 Configuration:  
The robot can move only in the 2D plane, $(x,y,\theta)$ is enough to represent it's configuration $q$. Therefore, the dimensions of configuration space $Q$ will be $R^{2}  \times S^{1}$.  
<p align="center">
$q = (x,y,\theta) \in Q = R^{2} \times S^{1} \tag{1}$
</p>
In most of the problems, we will be considering the robot as a circle of raidius $r$ for easier implementation. This will in fact eliminate the effect of changing $\theta$ on the configuration space. An example can be seen below:  

### 1.4 ROS Topics:  
```
* /scan - get laser data of an array of size 360, each index corresponds to each angle 
* /odom - get (x,y) coordinates of the robot 
* /imu  - get orientation of the robot
* /cmd_vel - publish desired linear and angular velocity of the robot
```  
### 1.5 Orientation Control:  
For navigation, we need to generate required angular velocity $\omega$ to acquire desired orientation/direction of motion. A simple PD controller can be used with a feedback of orientation from /imu topic. Below, the conventions of the orientation can be observed. We can see there's a jump from $+\pi$ to $-\pi$ which can create a problem when the current orientation is positive and desired orientation is negative. The robot will take a longer path to attain the desired orientations because this is how the rotation works! This needs to be handled.
