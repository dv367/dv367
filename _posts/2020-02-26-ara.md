### 8.1 We need some upgrades! Why?

Planning is a repeated process. We need to consider following situations:
* partially known environments
* dynamic environments
* improper execution of plan
* imprecise localization

We have following three searches:
* **Anytime heuristic search**: return best plan possible within T ms
* **Incremental heursitic search**: speed up search by reusing previous efforts
* **Real-Time heuristic search**: plan few steps towards te goal and re-plan later

In this post, we will be focussing on Anytime planners: **Anytime Repairing A\* star**.
