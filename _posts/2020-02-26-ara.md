### 8.1 We need some upgrades! Why?

Planning is a repeated process. We need to consider the following situations:
* partially known environments
* dynamic environments
* improper execution of plan
* imprecise localization
As a result, we need to plan fast and repeatedly.

Let me introduce three searches:
* **Anytime heuristic search**: return best plan possible within $T ms$
* **Incremental heursitic search**: speed up search by reusing previous efforts
* **Real-Time heuristic search**: plan few steps towards te goal and re-plan later

In this post, we will be focussing on Anytime planners: **Anytime Repairing A\* star**.

### 8.2 ComputePathWithReuse()
In **Figure 8.1**, the yellow nodes are the ones which were expanded i.e in CLOSED, which means that their $g-value$ is a finite value. On the contrary, the green nodes are in OPEN and their $g-values$ is $\infty$. We call these nodes as INCONSISTENT nodes.
