### 8.1 We need some upgrades! Why?

Planning is a repeated process. We need to consider the following situations:
* partially known environments
* dynamic environments
* improper execution of plan
* imprecise localization  

As a result, we need to plan fast and repeatedly.  
Let me introduce three searches:
* **Anytime heuristic search**: return best plan possible within $T ms$
* **Incremental heursitic search**: speed up search by reusing previous efforts
* **Real-Time heuristic search**: plan few steps towards te goal and re-plan later  

In this post, we will be focusing on Anytime planners: **Anytime Repairing A\* star**.

### 8.2 ComputePathWithReuse()

In this algorithm, we introduce a new set INCONSI for inconsistent nodes. **Inconsistent nodes** are those nodes whose $g-values$ can be smaller than what it is at current iteration. Let's take an example of a node which is in CLOSED and revisited by expanding a new node. Now, when the $g-value$ of that node (CLOSED) satisfies our first basic condition $g(s^{'})$ $>$ $g(s)$ + $c(s,s^{'})$ then the node is inconsistent. **So, what does it signify?** It tells us that there is a better way or smaller cost to reach that node. 

### 8.3 ARA\*
![att]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/ara_final2.PNG)
ARA\* is basically efficient series weighted A\* with decreasing $\epsilon$. At every iteration, the A\* is repaired: it is made better by initializing the OPEN set with already OPEN nodes (overconsistent) and INCONSISTENT nodes. As a result, we get closer to optimal solution at every iteration.

Note: In [2], they have introduced $v(n)$ variable which indicates whether a node is inconsitent or overconsistent (OPEN nodes after each search). However, this variable is not used in algorithm. As a result, I haven't introduced the variable and have explained inconsistent nodes in literature.
