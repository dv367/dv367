### 8.1 We need some upgrades! Why?

Planning is a repeated process. We need to consider the following situations:
* partially known environments
* dynamic environments
* improper execution of plan
* imprecise localization
As a result, we need to plan fast and repeatedly.

Let me introduce three searches:
* **Anytime heuristic search**: return best plan possible within $T ms$
* **Incremental heursitic search**: speed up search by reusing previous efforts
* **Real-Time heuristic search**: plan few steps towards te goal and re-plan later

In this post, we will be focussing on Anytime planners: **Anytime Repairing A\* star**.

### 8.2 ComputePathWithReuse()

In this algorithm, we introduce a new set INCONSI for inconsistent nodes. Inconsistent nodes are those nodes whose $g-values$ can be smaller than what it is currently. Let's take and example: a node which is in CLOSED and revisited by expanding a new node. Now, when the $g-value$ of that node (CLOSED) is satisfies our first basic condition $g(s^{'})$ $>$ $g(s)$ + $c(s,s^{'})$
