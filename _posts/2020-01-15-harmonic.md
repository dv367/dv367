### 5.1 Definition
In terms of vector calculus, till now it is clear we require a sinking vector field at goal, sourcing vector field near obstacles and uniform vector field elsewhere. For no local minimas, we want our vector field to be irrotational and incompressible i.e. the curl and divergence of the vector field should be zero (see **Figure 5.1** and **Figure 5.2**).
<p center="align">
$$curl V = \nabla x V = 0 \tag{1}$$
$$divergence   
</p>


A harmonic function is the one which satisfies the following differential equation.  
<p center="align">
$$\nabla^2\phi = 0 \tag{1}$$
</p>
