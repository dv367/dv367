### 9.1 Environment

So far we have seen Greedy, Dijsktra, A\*, Weighted A\*, Backward A\*, and ARA\*. Each of these searches work only in static environments. But, in dynamic environments they won't work because the $g-value$ of nodes will change with change in environment. In **Figure 9.1**, we can see that changes in $g-values$ when the door closes.
