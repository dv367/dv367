## 3. Potential Functions  
Basic idea: Potential function approach directs a robot as if it were a particle moving in a gradient vector field. Gradients can be viewed as forces acting on a positively charged particle robot attracted by negatively charged goal. Obstacles are also positively charged which forms a repulsive force directing the robot away from it.

A potential function can be constructed as the sum of attractive and repulsive potenials.

$U(q) = U_{att}(q) + U_{rep}(q) \tag{1}$
