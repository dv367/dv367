### Past projects    
##### - Fixed-Wing-Aerial Vehicle Trajectory Optimization in Urban Settings  
<p align="justify">
Developed a novel optimizer which exploits the computational structure of the non-linear trajectory optimization problem. The optimizer outperformed the state-of-the-art SQP solver ACADO in terms of computation time and quality of solution.
