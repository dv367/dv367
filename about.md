I'm Vivek Adajania pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Electronics Engineering at NIT Surat. My research interests are planning, control, and multi-agent systems. From my sophomore year, Iâ€™ve been a part of Team <a href="https://www.facebook.com/drishti.nitsurat">Drishti</a> (technical club) participating in the Asia-Pacific Robot Contest. It is an international robotics competition hosted every year by different Asian-Pacific countries (Japan, Vietnam, China, India, etc.) wherein robots compete to complete a given task in a set period of time. My primary work dealt with algorithmic and software development of autonomous navigation of Omni-directional robots.
